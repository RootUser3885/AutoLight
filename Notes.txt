Goals
	- Control multiple lights on a vehicle while maintaining safety
	- Allow custom effects but only if it is safe to do so
	- Change effect based on events whilst driving
	- Read said events from obd or CAN-Bus if possible
	- Send settings to WLED via Serial1 port

Effect List and ID
	1: Driving Lights
	2: Startup
	3: Blinker Drivers

	5: Hazards

Behavior
	- Startup effect can be anything
	- Once Speed > 0 then set to driving mode and stay
	- Show blinker effect during blinker use (duh)
	- same for the hazards
